# Psythereum :sparkles:

## Introduction :wave:
Psythereum is a groundbreaking platform designed to facilitate psychological therapy research. Our platform enables researchers to access valuable data extracted from therapy sessions conducted between psychiatrists and patients. With a strong emphasis on privacy and anonymity, the recorded data is fully anonymized, ensuring the protection of personal information. :lock:

## Problem Statement :thinking:
Psythereum primarily addresses the following challenges:

- Researchers lack access to authentic, consistent, and up-to-date data. :bar_chart:
- Psychiatrists encounter flexibility issues with working hours. :clock1:
- Patients seek anonymity and confidentiality, concerned about who can access their recordings, and they may feel insecure about meeting a psychiatrist in person. :lock:

## Approach :bulb:
To address the challenges faced by patients, therapists, and researchers, we propose building a secure and anonymous platform. This platform will enable users to have confidential sessions with their psychiatrists, with session recordings securely uploaded to a decentralized system. The recorded data will be fully encrypted, ensuring privacy and security. Researchers will have access to this anonymized and encrypted data, providing them with valuable insights for their studies.

The platform will offer the following benefits:

- Access to anonymized and encrypted data for researchers :mag:
- Decentralized storage system for secure data upload :cloud:
- Confidentiality and privacy of session recordings :closed_lock_with_key:
- Fully encrypted data for enhanced security :key:
- Secure and anonymous sessions for patients :bust_in_silhouette:
